Kubescape is the first open-source tool for testing if Kubernetes is deployed securely according to multiple frameworks:
regulatory, customized company policies and DevSecOps best practices, such as the  [NSA-CISA](https://www.armosec.io/blog/kubernetes-hardening-guidance-summary-by-armo) and the [MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/23/secure-containerized-environments-with-updated-threat-matrix-for-kubernetes/) .  
Kubescape scans K8s clusters, YAML files, and HELM charts, and detect misconfigurations and software vulnerabilities at early stages of the CI/CD pipeline and provides a risk score instantly and risk trends over time.
Kubescape integrates natively with other DevOps tools, including Jenkins, CircleCI and Github workflows.

# Options and examples

## Install on Windows

**Requires powershell v5.0+**

``` powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armosec/kubescape/master/install.ps1 | iex
```

Note: if you get an error you might need to change the execution policy (i.e. enable Powershell) with

``` powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser
```

## Install on macOS

1. ```
    brew tap armosec/kubescape
    ```
2. ```
    brew install kubescape
    ```

## Flags

| flag |  default | description | options |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-e`/`--exclude-namespaces` | Scan all namespaces | Namespaces to exclude from scanning. Recommended to exclude `kube-system` and `kube-public` namespaces |
| `-s`/`--silent` | Display progress messages | Silent progress messages |
| `-t`/`--fail-threshold` | `0` (do not fail) | fail command (return exit code 1) if result bellow threshold| `0` -> `100` |
| `-f`/`--format` | `pretty-printer` | Output format | `pretty-printer`/`json`/`junit` |
| `-o`/`--output` | print to stdout | Save scan result in file |
| `--use-from` | | Load local framework object from specified path. If not used will download latest |
| `--use-default` | `false` | Load local framework object from default path. If not used will download latest | `true`/`false` |
| `--exceptions` | | Path to an [exceptions obj](examples/exceptions.json). If not set will download exceptions from Armo management portal |
| `--submit` | `false` | If set, Kubescape will send the scan results to Armo management portal where you can see the results in a user-friendly UI, choose your preferred compliance framework, check risk results history and trends, manage exceptions, get remediation recommendations and much more. By default the results are not sent | `true`/`false`|
| `--keep-local` | `false` | Kubescape will not send scan results to Armo management portal. Use this flag if you ran with the `--submit` flag in the past and you do not want to submit your current scan results | `true`/`false`|
| `--account` | | Armo portal account ID. Default will load account ID from configMap or config file | |

## Usage & Examples

### Examples

* Scan a running Kubernetes cluster with [`nsa`](https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/Feature-Stories/Article-View/Article/2716980/nsa-cisa-release-kubernetes-hardening-guidance/) framework and submit results to [ARMO portal](https://portal.armo.cloud/)
```
kubescape scan framework nsa --submit
```


* Scan a running Kubernetes cluster with [`MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ`](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/23/secure-containerized-environments-with-updated-threat-matrix-for-kubernetes/) framework and submit results to [ARMO portal](https://portal.armo.cloud/)
```
kubescape scan framework mitre --submit
```


* Scan a running Kubernetes cluster with a specific control using the control name or control ID. [List of controls](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/controls) 
```
kubescape scan control "Privileged container"
```

* Scan local `yaml`/`json` files before deploying. [Take a look at the demonstration](https://youtu.be/Ox6DaR7_4ZI)
```
kubescape scan framework nsa *.yaml
```


* Scan kubernetes manifest files from a public github repository 
```
kubescape scan framework nsa https://github.com/armosec/kubescape
```

* Output in `json` format
```
kubescape scan framework nsa --exclude-namespaces kube-system,kube-public --format json --output results.json
```

* Output in `junit xml` format
```
kubescape scan framework nsa --exclude-namespaces kube-system,kube-public --format junit --output results.xml
```

* Scan with exceptions, objects with exceptions will be presented as `exclude` and not `fail`
```
kubescape scan framework nsa --exceptions examples/exceptions.json
```

### Helm Support

* Render the helm chart using [`helm template`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_template/) and pass to stdout
```
helm template [NAME] [CHART] [flags] --dry-run | kubescape scan framework nsa -
```

for example:
```
helm template bitnami/mysql --generate-name --dry-run | kubescape scan framework nsa -
```
### Offline Support

It is possible to run Kubescape offline!

First download the framework and then scan with `--use-from` flag

1. Download and save in file, if file name not specified, will store save to `~/.kubescape/<framework name>.json`
```
kubescape download framework nsa --output nsa.json
```

2. Scan using the downloaded framework
```
kubescape scan framework nsa --use-from nsa.json
```

Kubescape is an open source project, we welcome your feedback and ideas for improvement. We‚Äôre also aiming to collaborate with the Kubernetes community to help make the tests themselves more robust and complete as Kubernetes develops.

## Technology
Kubescape based on OPA engine: https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa and ARMO's posture controls.

The tools retrieves Kubernetes objects from the API server and runs a set of [regos snippets](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) developed by [ARMO](https://www.armosec.io/).

The results by default printed in a pretty "console friendly" manner, but they can be retrieved in JSON format for further processing.

Kubescape is an open source project, we welcome your feedback and ideas for improvement. We‚Äôre also aiming to collaborate with the Kubernetes community to help make the tests themselves more robust and complete as Kubernetes develops.
